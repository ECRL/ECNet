# Summary

[![UML Energy & Combustion Research Laboratory](http://faculty.uml.edu/Hunter_Mack/uploads/9/7/1/3/97138798/1481826668_2.png)](http://faculty.uml.edu/Hunter_Mack/)

ECNet is an open source Python package for creating large scale machine learning projects with a focus on fuel property prediction. A project is considered a collection of builds, and each build is a collection of nodes. Nodes are averaged to obtain a final predicted value for the build. For each node in a build, multiple neural networks are constructed and the best performing neural network is used as that node's predictor.

ECNet aims to provide scientists with an open-source tool for predicting key fuel properties for the next generation of fuels, without having to spend resources on fuel synthesis and experimentation.
